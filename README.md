		You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Gowthami11/gowthamipediredla.github.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
		I am a frontend engineer with an experience of over 4 years. I have hands on experienceworking with web frameworks and technologies. I have extensively worked on react and typescript for 3 years.
		

		Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
